### Hi! I'm Robin. :wave:

I've been building software (professionally or otherwise) since 2010. I love anything to do with procedural generation, DSLs, compilers, interpreters, and gamedev tools.

My current project is [Cursed Phone](https://github.com/TheBerkin/cursed_phone), an audio game engine for embedded applications such as interactive art installations.
Cursed Phone is designed to be installed onto specially converted telephone equipment to create unique and novel entertainment experiences.

I also created the [Rant](https://github.com/rant-lang/rant) templating language. Rant empowers creatives of all kinds with a powerful toolset for randomized and procedural generation of names, dialogue, characters, narratives, test data, and more.

Outside of this, I also sporadically develop a variety of smaller tools and libraries to make the lives of other developers a little easier.
